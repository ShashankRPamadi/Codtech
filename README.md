PENETRATION-TESTING-AND-CYBERSECURITY-TOOLKIT

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
NAME: SHASHANK R PAMADI  
INTERN ID: CT04WB126  
DOMAIN: CYBERSECURITY AND PENETRATION TESTING  
DURATION: 4 WEEKS  
MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH  

TASK 1: WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITY SCANNER

DESCRIPTION:
This task focused on building a Python-based scanner capable of detecting common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The scanner uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract forms from web pages and test them with payloads. The tool automates vulnerability testing by injecting malicious input and checking server responses.

It detects:
- SQL Injection points by sending payloads and analyzing error messages
- XSS by injecting scripts and checking reflected outputs

Itâ€™s built to simplify the first step of vulnerability analysis in web applications.

TASK 2: PENETRATION TESTING TOOLKIT

DESCRIPTION:
A modular penetration testing toolkit created in Python. It includes various tools that help perform different phases of penetration testing. Each module is separate and performs its own function.

Modules include:
- Port Scanner (TCP scanning using socket)
- Brute Force Tool (for SSH/FTP login testing)
- Banner Grabber (extracts version info from services)
- Host Discovery (checks live hosts)
- Whois and IP Info Lookup

This tool helps understand how basic reconnaissance and exploitation tools work. Every module is implemented from scratch using Python.

TASK 3: ADVANCED ENCRYPTION TOOL

DESCRIPTION:
A command-line based file encryption and decryption tool that uses AES-256 encryption. It accepts a user password, derives a strong key using PBKDF2, and encrypts files using the Cryptography library.

Main features:
- AES-256 encryption with random salt and IV
- Password-based key derivation
- Secure file decryption with correct password
- Supports any file type
- Safe for real use on personal files

This task taught me practical cryptography and how to build secure tools with Python.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:

This internship gave me practical experience with core cybersecurity tools. I learned how to build:
- A vulnerability scanner for web applications
- A modular penetration testing toolkit
- A secure AES-256 based encryption tool

Along the way, I improved my Python skills and gained better understanding of how real-world cybersecurity tools work. I now understand how to approach both offensive and defensive security techniques and build scripts that follow ethical hacking principles.

NOTE: All tools are for educational use only and should be used in authorized environments.
